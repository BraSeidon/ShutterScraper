# Mole

Mole (name is still being decided) is a powerful web scaping tool. Basically, you specify a URL and what you are scraping (outbound links or emails so far), and Mole will continuously crawl until a limit is reached.

## Highlights

- Crawl websites and gather any sort of information you want using regex
- All requests can be sent through a random proxy from your list of proxies
- Powered by the powerful RollingCurl, a FAST curl wrapper that supports asynchronous threads
- Framework-agnostic, will work with any project
- Composer ready and PSR-2 compliant

## Documentation

<strong>Documentation will be finished when v1.0.0 is up.</strong>

## Installation

Mole is available via Composer:

```bash
$ composer require braseidon/scraper
```

## Testing

Mole has a [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) test suite. To run the tests, run the following command from the project folder:

```bash
$ phpunit
```
